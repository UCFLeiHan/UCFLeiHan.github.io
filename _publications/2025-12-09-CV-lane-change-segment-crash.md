abstract: "Frequent crashes on urban arterial segments pose significant safety and mobility concerns. While existing safety studies primarily focus on macro infrastructure and traffic features, ignoring the critical influences of micro-level risky driving behavior (e.g., lane-changing). To address such gaps, we developed a directional-level segment crash analysis method, leveraging the high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data. A Constrained Gaussian Mixture Method was proposed to identify lane-changing behavior from raw CV trajectories. Micro-level driving behavior features were then extracted considering risky driving behavior, driving volatility, and aggressive speeding. A Bivariate hierarchical negative binomial model was employed to jointly estimate the heterogeneous impacts of driving behavior features on rear-end (RE) and sideswipe (SW) crashes. While a hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson model was utilized to identify significant contributors to speeding crashes. Empirical experiments at Hillsborough County highlight the critical role of risky driving behavior features for segment safety: (1) Segments with a high proportion of free-flow trajectories tend to experience fewer RE and SW crashes. (2) Driving fluctuation of stop-and-go vehicles is positively related to the frequency of RE crashes. (3) Risky right lane-changings coupled with hard accelerations are significantly associated with SW crashes. (4) Aggressive speeding behavior is highly related to speeding crashes."
