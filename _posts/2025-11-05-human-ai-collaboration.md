Recently, Gemini 3 was just released with remarkable coding capabilities. Intrigued by this, I decided to try it out in Google AI Studio to create my own game. Initially, I simply provided a basic instruction and envisioned a first-person shooter (FPS) game where players fight against zombies. To my surprise, it generated an impressive demo with professional-quality game mechanics. This inspired me to expand and refine the game, which I named "ZFighting".

However, at the final stage of development, the Google AI platform crashed completely and stopped working. So I downloaded the codes and transferred it to Cursor to continue development locally. Despite knowing nothing about the programming language, I successfully completed the game! Overall, ZFighting is an FPS game where players battle zombies and progress through levels. The game features: 
- Different types of zombies, each with unique damage abilities
- Various heroes, each with distinct ultimate abilities and weapon options
- A coin collection system that allows players to upgrade weapons and character functions

I packaged it as an executable file and shared it with my South Korean friends. They really enjoyed it and played it for fun. They also provided valuable feedback, which I incorporated to revise and improve various game functions. This has been a truly enjoyable experience during my Ph.D. journey. If you'd like to try it out, you can download the game [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16S63JOk-FvTXLhXcO8Ap2qVrSS95Qx4Q/view?usp=sharing) (*the file is ZFighting_V2.0.rar on my Google Drive*). I hope you enjoy playing it!
