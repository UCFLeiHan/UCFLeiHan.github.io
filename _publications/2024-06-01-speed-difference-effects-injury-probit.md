abstract: "Rear-end crashes particularly on freeways are the most frequent type of collisions causing many injuries, damage and congestion. This paper investigates the impact of varying speed differences between following and leading vehicles on injury severity in two-vehicle rear-end crashes. It develops three groups of correlated joint random parameters bivariate probit models with heterogeneity in means. The rear-end crash data from 2019 to 2021 on Interstate freeways in Florida are utilized, and categorized into periods before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The study considers two potential injury severity outcomes: no injury and injury/fatality, for both drivers involved in these crashes. The findings indicate that a range of variables, including driver, vehicle, roadway, environmental, crash, and temporal attributes, significantly influence the injury severity outcomes for drivers in both following and leading vehicles. Demonstrating superior goodness-of-fit, the proposed approach sheds light on interactive unobserved heterogeneity, captured through heterogeneity in means and significant correlations among random parameters. The study observes critical influences on the injury severity outcomes of both drivers, with significant factors such as gender, age, vehicle type, weather conditions, lighting, and time of day. Furthermore, the results substantiate the heightened risk outcomes associated with greater speed differences and the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings yield further insights into the risk mechanisms of two-vehicle rear-end crashes and offer guidance for the development of effective safety countermeasures."
